            <h4>First part</h4>
          . . . WOULD BEGIN WITH an image so startling and lovely and
           wondrous that you would stop riffling through the rest of the 
           mail, take your jacket off, sit down at the table, adjust your
            spectacles, tell the dog to lie down, tell the kids to make
             their own sandwiches for heavenssake, that’s why god gave
              you hands, and read straight through the piece, marveling
               that you had indeed seen or smelled or heard exactly that,
                but never quite articulated it that way, or seen or heard 
                it articulated that way, and you think, man, this is why
                 I read nature essays, to be startled and moved like that,
                  wow.  </P>
    </div>

        <P>
            <h4>Second part</h4>
            The next two paragraphs would smoothly and gently move
             you into a story, seemingly a small story, a light tale,
             easily accessed, something personal but not self-indulgent
              or self-absorbed on the writer’s part, just sort of a 
              cheerful nutty everyday story maybe starring an elk or a
               mink or a child, but then there would suddenly be a sharp
                sentence where the dagger enters your heart and the essay
                 spins on a dime like a skater, and you are plunged into
                  waaay deeper water, you didn’t see it coming at all, 
                  and you actually shiver, your whole body shimmers, and 
                  much later, maybe when you are in bed with someone you 
                  love and you are trying to evade his or her icy feet,
                   you think, my god, stories do have roaring power,
                    stories are the most crucial and necessary food,
                     how come we never hardly say that out loud?

        <h4>Third part</h4>
            The next three paragraphs then walk inexorably toward a
             line of explosive Conclusions on the horizon like inky
              alps. Probably the sentences get shorter, more staccato.
               Terser. Blunter. Shards of sentences. But there’s no
                opinion or commentary, just one line fitting into
                 another, each one making plain inarguable sense,
                  a goat or even a senator could easily understand 
                  the sentences and their implications, and there’s 
                  no shouting, no persuasion, no eloquent pirouetting, 
                  no pronouncements and accusations, no sermons or
                   homilies, just calm clean clear statements one 
                   after another, fitting together like people holding 
                   hands.
        </P>

        <P>
            <h4>Fourth part</h4>
            Then an odd paragraph, this is a most unusual and peculiar 
            essay, for right here where you would normally expect those
             alpine Conclusions, some Advice, some Stern Instructions &
              Directions, there’s only the quiet murmur of the writer
               tiptoeing back to the story he or she was telling you 
               in the second and third paragraphs. The story slips back 
               into view gently, a little shy, holding its hat, nothing
                melodramatic, in fact it offers a few gnomic questions 
                without answers, and then it gently slides away off the 
                page and off the stage, it almost evanesces or dissolves,
                 and it’s only later after you have read the essay three 
                 times with mounting amazement that you see quite how the
                  writer managed the stagecraft there, but that’s the
                   stuff of another essay for another time.
        </P>

    <div>
        <p3></p3>
        <p>
            <h4>fifth part</h4>
            And finally the last paragraph. It turns out that 
            the perfect nature essay is quite short, it’s a 
            lean taut thing, an arrow and not a cannon, and 
            here at the end there’s a flash of humor, and a
             hint or tone or subtext of sadness, a touch of
              rue, you can’t quite put your finger on it but
               it’s there, a dark thread in the fabric, and 
               there’s also a shot of espresso hope, hope against 
               all odds and sense, but rivetingly there’s no call 
               to arms, no clarion brassy trumpet blast, no website
                to which you are directed, no hint that you, yes you,
                 should be ashamed of how much water you use or the car
                  you drive or the fact that you just turned the
                   thermostat up to seventy, or that you actually
                    have not voted in the past two elections despite
                     what you told the kids and the goat. Nor is there 
                     a rimshot ending, a bang, a last twist of the dagger.
                      Oddly, sweetly, the essay just ends with a feeling 
                      eerily like a warm hand brushed against your cheek,
                       and you sit there, near tears, smiling, and then
                        you stand up. Changed.</p>
